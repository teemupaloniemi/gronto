# What?

Gronto is short for `GRaphs and ONTology to Opetussuunnitelma`. Gronto aims to
bring the [ACM Compute Classification System's](https://dl.acm.org/ccs)
benefits to curriculum design. We also touch some topics from [graph
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), and [satisfiability
solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories).
