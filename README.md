# What?

Gronto is short for `GRaphs and ONTology to Opetussuunnitelma`. Gronto aims to
bring the [ACM Compute Classification System's](https://dl.acm.org/ccs)
benefits to curriculum design. We also touch some topics from [graph
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), and [satisfiability
solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories).

The goal is to move towards a computable curriculum planning process by making
a software that constructs curriculum automatically just from course syllabi.
We focus specifically to the field of computer science. We do not assume to
replace the current meeting oriented process but rather make it a bit more
effective by fixing some problems. We like to think it as replacing old
bearings to make a car or bike a bit more efficient. Below we first list some
definitions and after that the problems we see and give a brief explanation on
why our solution solves the issue.
