# What?

Gronto is short for `GRaphs and ONTology to Opetussuunnitelma`. Gronto aims to
bring the [ACM Compute Classification System's](https://dl.acm.org/ccs)
benefits to curriculum design. We also touch some topics from [graph
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), and [satisfiability
solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories).

# TODO

- Yes, but why?
- Is the problem social or technical?
- Collect more data?
   - Is it iterable or one-shot? Stability wrt data?
- Test other possible distance metrics?
- Test other possible ontologies?
   - What properties should these things have for them to work?
- How to evaluate the effectiveness of the system?
- Why did we choose this method/these methods?
   - racket, smt, graphs, ontology, etc.
- What end user gets? What end used has to provide?
- Compare to other solutions?
- What remains for even better world?
- End user experiances resulting from the use of this system?
- How long does this system survive in an organization? What about maintenance?
